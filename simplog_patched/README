Simplog - A complete and powerful blogging tool
=================================================
 
Welcome to Simplog!
 
Thanks for downloading this software.
 
Simplog is free software, released under GNU GPL Licence version 2.0
(see LICENSE file for details)

Simplog was created to provide people with an easy way to create and maintain
their own personal or a community weblog.  With the increasing number of people
creating on-line journals, there is a need for a tool that allows them a quick
and easy way to share their lives with the rest of the world.

Simplog is NOT trying to a news/portal app like Slash/Scoop/PHP-Nuke, nor
will it ever be, although it can be used for this purpose.  Simplog is
intended for use as a personal or community weblog tool.

Thank you for using Simplog!
