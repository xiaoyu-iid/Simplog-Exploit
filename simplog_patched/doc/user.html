 <b>Creating/Editing Blog Entries</b>
 <p>
 After logging in, you'll come to the main entry screen.  On the left, you'll have a menu and a form for creating/editing entries.  On the right, you'll have a list of all blogs that you have editing rights and a list of the 5 most recent entries you have made to the currently selected blog.
 <p>
 <li>Create/Edit an entry
 <p>
 Use the form to select a category, enter a title for your entry, and enter the text of your entry.  HTML is allowed in all posts.  If you wish to preserve the format of your entry without using HTML, please make sure the 'Preserve formatting' checkbox is checked.  You can also have Simplog translate text links and email address into web links for you simply by checking the 'Translate links' checkbox.  If the blog super user has enabled it, you can check the 'send update notice to weblogs.com' checkbox and have a notification sent to the weblogs.com website(this may cause long load times upon saving).  When finished, you can preview your entry with the 'Preview' button.  To save your entry, click the 'Save' button.  If editing, click the 'Update' button to save your changes and the 'Cancel' button to cancel your changes.

To learn more about trackback, visit <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/beginners/" target="_new">http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/beginners/</a>.

 <b>Displaying Your Blog</b>
 <p>
 Simplog was designed to only display your blog entries, leaving the layout and look of the actual blog page to the end user.  Your blog entries should be displayed via an 'included' file.  This means you should use a Server-Side Include(in the case of HTML files) or PHP's include() function.  All you need to do is reference the blog.php and set the blogid (the id number of your blog, the number next to your blog's name in the blog list on the entry screen).
 <br>Examples:<p>
 HTML SSI: <br>
 <dl><dd>
 &lt;!-- #include virtual("/simplog/blog.php?blogid=2" --&gt;<br>
 (if blog.php is on a different webserver, use the full URL)
 </dd></dl>
 PHP include(local machine):<br>
 <dl><dd>
 <pre>
 &lt;?
 	$blogid = 2;
	include("blog.php");
 ?&gt;
 </pre>
 </dd></dl>
 PHP include(remote machine):<br>
 <dl><dd>
  <pre>
 &lt;?
 	include("http://www.example.com/simplog/blog.php?blogid=2");
 ?&gt;
  </pre>
 </dd></dl>
 Side blocks are also displayed in a similar manner using the blocks.php file.  Your blog can even be included with other server side scripting languages similar to the example above.  The demo.php script is an example of a blog page using the PHP include function.

 <b>Searching Your Blog</b>
 <p>
 You and visitors to your site can now search your blog entries either via the archive or the search block(if the blog administrator has enabled it).  In the archive, he search box is underneath the calendar on the right-hand side of the page.  This search currently only searches the entry titles and bodies.

 <b>Troubleshooting</b>
 <p>
 Q: I can't log in!<p>
 A: Please make sure that cookies are enabled in your browser and make sure that you are typing you password correctly.  Password ARE case sensitive.
 <p>
 Q:I point my browser at 'http://mydomain/myphpblog' but I don't get the login
 screen, I get a directory listing?<p>
 A: Quick fix: point at 'http://mydomain/myphpblog/login.php<br>
    Proper fix: Your webserver is not set up to show index.php as a
    default page. Apache deals with this with the 'DirectoryIndex'
	directive in httpd.conf<p>
 Q: I'm using the PHP include function to include my blog from a remote machine, but get the error message "Warning: Failed opening 'http://mydomain.com/myphpblog/blog.php?blogid=1' for inclusion....."<p>
 A: First, make sure that you can view 'http://mydomain.com/myphpblog/blog.php?blogid=1' in your browser.  If so, then it is likely that your PHP configuration is set to not allow the include() function to include URLs.  If you can edit the php.ini file on your sever, set the allow_url_fopen parameter to 'On'.  If not, you can try using the virtual() function, but that may not work either(and isn't recommended in the PHP Manual).  If all else fails, try to run your blog locally.
 <p>
 Q: I saved an entry and saw this error message<p>
 <code>Can't open stream because TCP/IP error code 10060 - Connection timed out.</code><p>
 What does this mean?
 <p>
 A: You were trying to send a notification to weblogs.com and the connection timed out trying to send the notification.
